<!--
The <html></html> tag is used to define the root of an HTML document.

When trying to find the correct tag you can use the following search prompt:
"What HTML tag is used for ______?" In this case you'd want to know which tag is used for heading.

All heading tags go along with the structure of <h_></h_>. Meaning h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6.
The h1 tag has the biggest font size and is used to write titles with emphasis.
Here's a snippet detailing how the code would look:

<h1>This a heading 1 element</h1>
-->
<html>This a heading 1 element</html1>
<!--
    The head   
-->
<head>
  This is the start of a really short paragraph. It has some other nested tags to emphasise/highlight some of the text. For example:
  <b>This is bold text.</b>
  And, even more exciting:
  <i>This is italic text!</i>
</head>

<body>
  This is a paragraph explaining the image below.
  Remember: images use a self-closing tag, and the image URL is set by the "src" attribute.
</body1>

<title="https://i.ibb.co/hZSW3Fg/ice-cream-bowls.png" />

<h3>This is a subheadline wrapped in "h3" tags.</h3>

<html>
  If we have a URL like the one at the end of this paragraph then it should be hyperlinked using the correct tag:
  <body>https://www.google.com.au<body1>
  </html>

<title>Please wrap my favorite YouTube video below in the correct tag</title>
