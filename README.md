# Welcome! ðŸ˜ƒ
------------------
This is where you can come and find notes and feedback to your assignments. The feedback you find here will be helpful for you to attempt your exercises as many times as you'd like. 

You each have your own folders and files holding my feedback to your submissions. You have the ability to fork and clone these files into your VS Code so that they can live on your computer. **I encourage you doing this, let me know if you need any assistance.**

I will also provide any and all notes requested here, within the notes folder.

**Feel free to reach me at destinyh@ffg.digital**
