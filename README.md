# Here is where I'll give you guys feedback and post any and all of my notes.
------------------
You each have your own file holding my feedback to your submissions. You have the ability to fork and clone these files into your VS Code so that they can live on your computer. **I encourage you doing this, let me know if you need any assistance.**
