# Learning JavaScript
The language of most modern web browsers<br>

## Basics
**syntax**- the set of rules that define the meaning of an arrangement of symbols.<br>
Console- displays important messages, like errors.<br>
`;` - semicolons are placed at the end of a line or statement.<br>

**Comments**- can explain what the code is doing, leave instructions for others and just add useful annotations.<br>
A single line comment will take up one line
`//This is a single line comment taking up one line and one line only.`<br>

A multi-line comment will take up more than one line. You use `/*` to begin your comment and `*/` to end your comment.<br>

## Data Types
Data types - the classifications given to each type of data we use. In JavaScript **there are 7 types**.<br>
- Number- any number, including those with decimals.(Written without quotes)
- String(text)- any grouping of characters (letters, numbers,spaces, symbols) surrounded by single quotes ('...').
- Boolean- this data type has two possible values, `true` and `false`. Its helpful to think of booleans as off and on switches.
- `null`- this data type represents the intentional absence of a value and is represented by the keyword `null`.
- `undefined`- this also represents the absence of a value **BUT** this means the value _doesnt exist_.
- Symbol- unique identifiers, useful in complex coding.
- Object- collections of related data.

## Arithmetic Operators
Operator- a character that performs a task in our code.<br>
Add `+`<br>
Subtract `-`<br>
Multiply `*` <br>
Divide `/` <br>
Remainder `%` aka modulo- returns the number that remains after dividing the right evenly into the left digit.<br>
Concatenation- the process of appending one string to another.<br>
```
console.log('hi'+'ya') //Prints 'hiya'
console.log('middle'+ ' ' + 'space') //Prints 'middle space'
```

## Properties
All data types have properties that the developer can access for information about the data type. These properties are passed down to each instance of a data types.<br>
For example, **length** is a property that stores the # of characters in a _string_.
