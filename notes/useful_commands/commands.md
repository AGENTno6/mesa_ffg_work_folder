# Here's a list of useful commands that you'll repeatedly use in your VS Code terminal and or in teh console.

`cd` = change directory.
**(Ie. cd mesa_ffg_work_folder/notes)**
If I wanted to go from the notes folder into the main folder I'd use `cd ..`.

This command is used to make a new directory(folder) within your VS Code environment.
`mkdir` = make directory.
