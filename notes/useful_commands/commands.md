# The Command Line Interface, Introduction to Git, GitHub and VSCode

Here's a list of useful commands that you'll repeatedly use in your VS Code terminal and or in the console.

`cd` = change directory.
**(Ie. cd mesa_ffg_work_folder/notes)**
If I wanted to go from the notes folder into the main folder I'd use `cd ..`.

**This command is used to make a new directory(folder) within your VS Code environment.**
<br>`mkdir` = make directory.

`ls` = list = when you use this command it will list all the contents of that folder.

`git status` = shows you the status of the modified files.

`git add [filename]` = allows you to add a file or all (.) to your stage to be committed to the history.

`git push` = allows you to push up all your committed code to your remote GitHub environment.

`git reset [filename]` = allows you to unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory.
