# HTML Basics

## The Basics

- HTML elements are created with tags: `<openingTag>content to be shown</closingTag>`.
- Some HTML elements have self closing tags like the image tag: `<img />`.
- HTML elements have **attributes** that add necessary information about the element.
  - **Ie:** The `src` attribute used in an image element, `<img />`, tells the browser which image to display.
  - **Ie:** The `href` attribute tells the browser where to direct users who click on the link. `<a href="insert url here">Click this link!</a>`
  - Other attributes like the `id` and `class` attributes do come in handy to add additional information but we wont worry about them just yet.

```
<div class='container'>
   <h1>This is a heading wrapped in 'h1' tags.</h1>
   <p>This is some text.</p>
   <img alt="a picture of a cat" src="some-animal-photo.jpg">
   <a href="https://www.mesacharter.org/">Click here to visit the MESA Charter HS website.</a>
   <p id="last-paragraph">This is some fluff.</p>
</div>

<br> `<img />` -> **the image tag** -> this element is used to link an image to your webpage. In order to link

## Everything is a Box!!

**Things to know:**

- HTML and CSS are languages just like JavaScript.
  - Lets look back at our toolbags to remember what each language allows us to do:

I know it sounds quirky but the best way to think when it comes to HTML is with the idea that **everything is a box**.
