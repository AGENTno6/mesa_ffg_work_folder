<!--The style attribute within the h1 tag below only needs to be declared once, this is a great start but here's what the code would look like. Each aspect you're changing (padding, font-size, etc) is separated by a semicolon (;), therefore no need to declare that you're working with the style attribute.

<h1 
style= "padding: 10px; 
background-color: green;
color: white;">

-->
<h1 
style="padding: 10px; 
style= "background-color: green;" 
style= "color: white;">
  This is the main heading that is wrapped in "h1" tags.

    You started off very strong by using the <strong></strong> tag, you also changed the color of the text to blue but what you forgot to do was place the "MAKE THIS TEXT BLUE" text in between your strong tag.

  Vestibulum molestie semper facilisis. Vestibulum finibus sit amet metus eget elementum. Morbi sed eros orci.

    You used the correct tag but it looks like you may have forgotten how to change the color to blue. You always want to declare that you're manipulating the style attribute.
    The complete code would look like this:
    <em style="color:blue;">MAKE THIS TEXT BLUE</em>
  -->

  <em>"color: blue;"</em>
  Nullam lacinia interdum felis sit amet aliquet.

  You forgot to change the 'border-radius' to 50% within the img tag.

  This is the subheadline that is wrapped in "h3" tags.

<!--
  Great start here, the href attribute allows you define the link that you are linking to your application, therefore if you want to change the styling of an element you want to declare that you're manipulating that attribute. (style="color:green;").
  No need to wrap the a tag with the google link in another a tag. Instead just declare the style attribute within the a tag with the text within it.

  <a href="https://www.google.com.au">I'm a link to google</a>

<!--Here, the only misuse I see is that there is a closing iframe tag before your video. -->
